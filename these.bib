	volume = {3},
	issn = {1074-5521},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A structurally diverse group of bioactive peptides is synthesized by peptide synthetases which act as templates for a growing peptide chain, attached to the enzyme via a thioester bond. The protein templates are composed of distinctive substrate-activating modules, whose order dictates the primary structure of the corresponding peptide product. Each module contains defined domains that catalyze adenylation, thioester and peptide bond formation, as well as substrate modifications. To show that a putative thiolation domain ({PCP}) is involved in covalent binding and transfer of amino acyl residues during non-ribosomal peptide synthesis, we have cloned and biochemically characterized that region of tyrocidine synthetase 1, {TycA}.
{RESULTS}: The 327-bp gene fragment encoding {PCP} was cloned using its homology to the genes for the acyl carrier proteins of fatty acid and polyketide biosynthesis. The protein was expressed as a His6 fusion protein, and purified in a single step by affinity chromatography. Incorporation of beta-[3H]alanine, a precursor of coenzyme A, demonstrated the modification of {PCP} with the cofactor 4'-phosphopantetheine. When an adenylation domain is present to supply the amino adenylate moiety, {PCP} can be acylated in vitro.
{CONCLUSIONS}: {PCP} can bind covalently to the cofactor phosphopantetheine and can subsequently be acylated, strongly supporting the multiple carrier model of non-ribosomal peptide synthesis. The adenylation and thiolation domains can each act as independent multifunctional enzymes, further confirming the modular structure of peptide synthases, and can also perform sequential steps in trans, as do multienzyme complexes.},

One possible explanation was that the majority of introduced C domains were unable to effectively communicate with the thiolation (T) domain immediately upstream, in the first module of {PvdD}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Many pharmacologically important peptides are synthesized nonribosomally by multimodular peptide synthetases ({NRPSs}). These enzyme templates consist of iterated modules that, in their number and organization, determine the primary structure of the corresponding peptide products. At the core of each module is an adenylation domain that recognizes the cognate substrate and activates it as its aminoacyl adenylate. Recently, the crystal structure of the phenylalanine-activating adenylation domain {PheA} was solved with phenylalanine and {AMP}, illustrating the structural basis for substrate recognition.
{RESULTS}: By comparing the residues that line the phenylalanine-binding pocket in {PheA} with the corresponding moieties in other adenylation domains, general rules for deducing substrate specificity were developed. We tested these in silico 'rules' by mutating specificity-conferring residues within {PheA}. The substrate specificity of most mutants was altered or relaxed. Generalization of the selectivity determinants also allowed the targeted specificity switch of an aspartate-activating adenylation domain, the crystal structure of which has not yet been solved, by introducing a single mutation.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In silico studies and structure-function mutagenesis have defined general rules for the structural basis of substrate recognition in adenylation domains of {NRPSs}. These rules can be used to rationally alter the specificity of adenylation domains and to predict from the primary sequence the specificity of biochemically uncharacterized adenylation domains. Such efforts could enhance the structural diversity of peptide antibiotics such as penicillins, cyclosporins and vancomycins by allowing synthesis of 'unnatural' natural products.},

	abstract = {Recently, considerable insight has been gained into the modular organization and catalytic properties of nonribosomal peptide synthetases. However, molecular and biochemical aspects of the condensation of two aminoacyl substrates or a peptidyl and an aminoacyl substrate, leading to the formation of a peptide bond, have remained essentially impenetrable. To investigate this crucial part of nonribosomal peptide synthesis, an in vitro assay for a dipeptide formation was developed. Two recombinant holomodules, {GrsA} ({PheATE}), providing D-Phe, and a C-terminally truncated {TycB}, corresponding to the first, L-Pro-incorporating module ({ProCAT}), were investigated. Upon combination of the two aminoacylated modules, a fast reaction is observed, due to the formation of the linear dipeptide D-Phe-L-Pro-S-enzyme on {ProCAT}, followed by a noncatalyzed release of the dipeptide from the enzyme. The liberated product was identified by {TLC}, high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, 1H and 13C {NMR}, and comparison with a chemically synthesized standard to be the expected D-Phe-L-Pro diketopiperazine. Further minimization of the two modules was not possible without a loss of transfer activity. Likewise, a mutation in a proposed active-site motif ({HHXXXDG}) of the condensation domain giving {ProCAT}(H147V), abolished the condensation reaction. These results strongly suggest the condensation domain to be involved in the catalysis of nonribosomal peptide bond formation with the histidine 147 playing a catalytic role.},

Whereas bacterial {NRPSs} use thioesterase domains to perform the cyclization, fungal {NRPSs} have apparently evolved to use a different enzymatic route. In verified fungal {NRPSs} that produce macrocyclic peptides, each megasynthetase terminates with a condensation-like ({CT}) domain that may perform the macrocyclization reaction. To probe the role of such a {CT} domain, we reconstituted the activities of the Penicillium aethiopicum trimodular {NPRS} {TqaA} in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in vitro. Together with the reconstituted bimodular {NRPS} {AnaPS}, we dissected the cyclization steps of {TqaA} in transforming the linear anthranilate-D-tryptophan-L-alanyl tripeptide into fumiquinazoline F. Extensive biochemical and mutational studies confirmed the essential role of the {CT} domain in catalyzing cyclization in a thiolation domain–dependent fashion. Our work provides evidence of a likely universal macrocyclization strategy used by fungal {NRPSs}.

The first 6 residues of the biosurfactant lipopeptidolactone arthrofactin have the D configuration, yet none of the 11 modules of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase assembly line have epimerization domains. We show that the two-module {ArfA} subunit and the first module of the {ArfB} subunit, which act in tandem to produce the N-acyl-D-Leu1-D-Asp2-D-Thr3-S-protein intermediate, activate the L amino acids and epimerize them as the aminoacyl-S-pantetheinyl T domain intermediates before the next downstream condensation. The condensation (C) domains are shown to have {DCL} chirality in peptide bond formation. The upstream aminoacyl/peptidyl moiety is epimerized before condensation only when the condensation domains are simultaneously presented with the L-aminoacyl-S-pantetheinyl acceptor. These {DCL} catalysts are dual function condensation/epimerization domains that can be predicted by bioinformatics analysis to be responsible for incorporation of all D residues in arthrofactin and of D residues in syringomycin, syringopeptin, and ramoplanin synthetases.},

The 84 kb gene cluster contains 25 {ORFs} and is located within a 116 kb genetic locus that was fully sequenced. Targeted disruption of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase ({NRPS}) genes in the cluster abolished enduracidin production and confirmed function. The cluster includes four genes, {endA}-D, encoding two-, seven-, eight- and one-module {NRPSs}, respectively, and includes unique modules for the incorporation of citrulline and enduracididine. The {NRPS} organization generally follows the collinearity principle, and starts with a condensation domain (C domain) similar to those found in other lipopeptide systems for the coupling of an acyl group to the starting amino acid. The sixth module of {EndB}, corresponding to Thr8, is missing an adenylation domain (A domain) and this module is presumed to be loaded in trans by the single module protein {EndD}. The most striking feature of the {NRPS} organization is the lack of epimerization domains (E domains) in light of the fact that the product has seven d-amino acid residues. Sequence analysis reveals that C domains following modules corresponding to d-amino acids belong to a unique subset of C domains able to catalyse both epimerization and condensation reactions. Other genes directing lipid modification and activation, and formation of the non-proteinogenic amino acids 4-hydroxyphenylglycine and enduracididine are readily identified, as are genes possibly involved in regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis and export. These findings provide the basis to further genetically manipulate and improve lipodepsipeptide antibiotics via combinatorial and chemical methods.},

The excised {TE} domain from the nonribosomal peptide synthetase responsible for the production of the cyclic decapeptide tyrocidine A, {TycC} {TE}, retains autonomous ability to catalyze head-to-tail macrocyclization of a linear peptide thioester with the native sequence of tyrocidine A and can additionally cyclize peptide analogs that incorporate limited alterations in the peptide sequence. Here we show that {TycC} {TE} can catalyze macrocyclization of peptide substrates that are dramatically different from the native tyrocidine linear precursor. Several peptide thioesters that retain a limited number of elements of the native peptide sequence are shown to be substrates for {TycC} {TE}. These peptides were designed to integrate an Arg-Gly-Asp sequence that confers potential activity in the inhibition of ligand binding by integrin receptors. Although enzymatic hydrolysis of the peptide thioester substrates is preferred over cyclization, {TycC} {TE} can be used on a preparative scale to generate both linear and cyclic peptide products for functional characterization. The products are shown to be inhibitors of ligand binding by integrin receptors, with cyclization and Nα-methylation being important contributors to the nanomolar potency of the best inhibitors of fibrinogen binding to α{IIbβ}3 integrin. This study provides evidence for {TycC} {TE} as a versatile macrocyclization catalyst and raises the prospect of using {TE} catalysis for the generation of diverse macrocyclic peptide libraries that can be probed for novel biological function.},

	abstract = {In the biosynthesis of many macrocyclic natural products by multidomain megasynthases, a carboxy-terminal thioesterase ({TE}) domain is involved in cyclization and product release; however, it has not been determined whether {TE} domains can catalyse macrocyclization (and elongation in the case of symmetric cyclic peptides) independently of upstream domains. The inability to decouple the {TE} cyclization step from earlier chain assembly steps has precluded determination of {TE} substrate specificity, which is important for the engineered biosynthesis of new compounds. Here we report that the excised {TE} domain from tyrocidine synthetase efficiently catalyses cyclization of a decapeptide-thioester to form the antibiotic tyrocidine A, and can catalyse pentapeptide-thioester dimerization followed by cyclization to form the antibiotic gramicidin S. By systematically varying the decapeptide-thioester substrate and comparing cyclization rates, we also show that only two residues (one near each end of the decapeptide) are critical for cyclization. This specificity profile indicates that the tyrocidine synthetase {TE}, and by analogy many other {TE} domains, will be able to cyclize and release a broad range of new substrates and products produced by engineered enzymatic assembly lines.},

By combining sequence‐based knowledge with biochemical precedent, translated gene sequence data can be used to rapidly derive structural elements encoded by secondary metabolic gene clusters from microorganisms. These structural elements provide an estimate of the secondary metabolic potential of a given organism and a starting point for identification of potential lead compounds in isolation/structure elucidation campaigns. The accuracy of these predictions for a given translated gene sequence depends on the biochemistry of the metabolite class, similarity to known metabolite gene clusters, and depth of knowledge concerning its biosynthetic machinery. This chapter introduces methods for prediction of structural elements for two well‐studied classes: modular polyketides and nonribosomally encoded peptides. A bioinformatics tool is presented for rapid preliminary analysis of these modular systems, and prototypical methods for converting these analyses into substructural elements are described.},

We demonstrate the usefulness of this method on the example of aryl acid-activating and amino acid-activating adenylation domains (A domains) of nonribosomal peptide synthetases ({NRPS}). The residues of gramicidin synthetase A that are 8 Å around the substrate amino acid and corresponding positions of other adenylation domain sequences with 397 known and unknown specificities were extracted and used to encode this physico-chemical fingerprint into normalized real-valued feature vectors based on the physico-chemical properties of the amino acids. The {SVM} software package {SVMlight} was used for training and classification, with transductive {SVMs} to take advantage of the information inherent in unlabeled data. Specificities for very similar substrates that frequently show cross-specificities were pooled to the so-called composite specificities and predictive models were built for them. The reliability of the models was confirmed in cross-validations and in comparison with a currently used sequence-comparison-based method. When comparing the predictions for 1230 {NRPS} A domains that are currently detectable in {UniProt}, the new method was able to give a specificity prediction in an additional 18\% of the cases compared with the old method. For 70\% of the sequences both methods agreed, for {\textless}6\% they did not, mainly on low-confidence predictions by the existing method. None of the predictive methods could infer any specificity for 2.4\% of the sequences, suggesting completely new types of specificity.},

Prediction of A-domain specificity based on the sequence alone can be achieved through sequence signatures or, more accurately, through machine learning methods. We present an improved predictor, based on previous work ({NRPSpredictor}), that predicts A-domain specificity using Support Vector Machines on four hierarchical levels, ranging from gross physicochemical properties of an A-domain’s substrates down to single amino acid substrates. The three more general levels are predicted with an F-measure better than 0.89 and the most detailed level with an average F-measure of 0.80. We also modeled the applicability domain of our predictor to estimate for new A-domains whether they lie in the applicability domain. Finally, since there are also {NRPS} that play an important role in natural products chemistry of fungi, such as peptaibols and cephalosporins, we added a predictor for fungal A-domains, which predicts gross physicochemical properties with an F-measure of 0.84.

Genes involved in their biosynthesis are often organized in clusters, i.e., are co-localized and co-expressed.

{RESULTS}: We present Cluster Assignment by Islands of Sites ({CASSIS}), a method for {SM} cluster prediction in eukaryotic genomes, and Secondary Metabolites by {InterProScan} ({SMIPS}), a tool for genome-wide detection of {SM} key enzymes ('anchor' genes): polyketide synthases, non-ribosomal peptide synthetases and dimethylallyl tryptophan synthases. Unlike other tools based on protein similarity, {CASSIS} exploits the idea of co-regulation of the cluster genes, which assumes the existence of common regulatory patterns in the cluster promoters. The method searches for 'islands' of enriched cluster-specific motifs in the vicinity of anchor genes. It was validated in a series of cross-validation experiments and showed high sensitivity and specificity.

The transcriptional expression of these genes is often cooperatively regulated by a transcription factor located inside or close to a cluster. Most of the secondary metabolism biosynthesis ({SMB}) gene clusters identified to date contain so-called core genes with distinctive sequence features, such as polyketide synthase ({PKS}) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase ({NRPS}). Recent efforts in sequencing fungal genomes have revealed far more {SMB} gene clusters than expected based on the number of core genes in the genomes. Several bioinformatics tools have been developed to survey {SMB} gene clusters using the sequence motif information of the core genes, including {SMURF} and {antiSMASH}. More recently, accompanied by the development of sequencing techniques allowing to obtain large-scale genomic and transcriptomic data, motif-independent prediction methods of {SMB} gene clusters, including {MIDDAS}-M, have been developed. Most these methods detect the clusters in which the genes are cooperatively regulated at transcriptional levels, thus allowing the identification of novel {SMB} gene clusters regardless of the presence of the core genes. Another type of the method, {MIPS}-{CG}, uses the characteristics of {SMB} genes, which are highly enriched in non-syntenic blocks ({NSBs}), enabling the prediction even without transcriptome data although the results have not been evaluated in detail. Considering that large portion of {SMB} gene clusters might be sufficiently expressed only in limited uncommon conditions, it seems that prediction of {SMB} gene clusters by bioinformatics and successive experimental validation is an only way to efficiently uncover hidden {SMB} gene clusters. Here, we describe and discuss possible novel approaches for the determination of {SMB} gene clusters that have not been identified using conventional methods.},

	abstract = {New bioinformatic tools are needed to analyze the growing volume of {DNA} sequence data. This is especially true in the case of secondary metabolite biosynthesis, where the highly repetitive nature of the associated genes creates major challenges for accurate sequence assembly and analysis. Here we introduce the web tool Natural Product Domain Seeker ({NaPDoS}), which provides an automated method to assess the secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene diversity and novelty of strains or environments. {NaPDoS} analyses are based on the phylogenetic relationships of sequence tags derived from polyketide synthase ({PKS}) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase ({NRPS}) genes, respectively. The sequence tags correspond to {PKS}-derived ketosynthase domains and {NRPS}-derived condensation domains and are compared to an internal database of experimentally characterized biosynthetic genes. {NaPDoS} provides a rapid mechanism to extract and classify ketosynthase and condensation domains from {PCR} products, genomes, and metagenomic datasets. Close database matches provide a mechanism to infer the generalized structures of secondary metabolites while new phylogenetic lineages provide targets for the discovery of new enzyme architectures or mechanisms of secondary metabolite assembly. Here we outline the main features of {NaPDoS} and test it on four draft genome sequences and two metagenomic datasets. The results provide a rapid method to assess secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene diversity and richness in organisms or environments and a mechanism to identify genes that may be associated with uncharacterized biochemistry.},

The current number of involved nonisobaric and isobaric building blocks is 287 and 521, respectively. Contrary to all other peptide sequencing tools utilizing either peptide libraries or peptide fragment libraries, {CycloBranch} represents a true de novo sequencing engine developed for accurate mass spectrometric data. It is a stand-alone and cross-platform application with a graphical and user-friendly interface; it supports {mzML}, {mzXML}, mgf, txt, and baf file formats and can be run in parallel on multiple threads.

In bacteria and fungi, in addition to the traditional ribosomal proteic biosynthesis, an alternative ribosome-independent pathway called {NRP} synthesis allows peptide production. It is performed by huge protein complexes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases ({NRPSs}). The molecules synthesized by {NRPS} contain a high proportion of nonproteogenic amino acids. The primary structure of these peptides is not always linear but often more complex and may contain cycles and branchings. In recent years, {NRPs} attracted a lot of attention because of their biological activities and pharmacological properties (antibiotic, immunosuppressor, antitumor, etc.). However, few computational resources and tools dedicated to those peptides have been available so far. Norine is focused on {NRPs} and contains more than 700 entries. The database is freely accessible at http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/norine/. It provides a complete computational tool for systematic study of {NRPs} in numerous species, and as such, should permit to obtain a better knowledge of these metabolic products and underlying biological mechanisms, and ultimately to contribute to the redesigning of natural products in order to obtain new bioactive compounds for drug discovery.},

However identifying new biologically active small molecules is still a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a new activity prediction approach using Bayesian belief network for classification ({BBNC}). The roots of the network are the fragments composing a compound. The leaves are, on one side, the activities to predict and, on another side, the unknown compound. The activities are represented by sets of known compounds, and sets of inactive compounds are also used. We calculated a similarity between an unknown compound and each activity class. The more similar activity is assigned to the unknown compound. We applied this new approach on eight well-known data sets extracted from the literature and compared its performance to three classical machine learning algorithms. Experiments showed that {BBNC} provides interesting prediction rates (from 79\% accuracy for high diverse data sets to 99\% for low diverse ones) with a short time calculation. Experiments also showed that {BBNC} is particularly effective for homogeneous data sets but has been found to perform less well with structurally heterogeneous sets. However, it is important to stress that we believe that using several approaches whenever possible for activity prediction can often give a broader understanding of the data than using only one approach alone. Thus, {BBNC} is a useful addition to the computational chemist?s toolbox.},

In this paper, we present a novel peptide fingerprint based on monomer composition ({MCFP}) of {NRPs}. {MCFP} is a novel method for obtaining a representative description of {NRP} structures from their monomer composition in fingerprint form. Experiments with Norine {NRPs} database and {MCFP} show high prediction accuracy ({\textgreater}93 \%). Also a high recall rate ({\textgreater}82 \%) is obtained when {MCFP} is used for screening {NRPs} database.

We describe a combination of approaches towards lowering the computational cost and improving the response time of substructure queries. An exhaustive comparison of the {AMBIT} algorithm with several subgraph isomorphism implementations is performed. To demonstrate the performance of the entire system from an end-user point of view, response time statistics for Web service substructure search queries against a database of 4.5 M structures are also reported. The package has wide applicability in the implementation of various chemoinformatics tasks.

Given a set of small molecules—for example, those known to bind a particular protein—computationally decomposing them into chemically meaningful fragments can help elucidate their functional properties, and may be useful for designing novel compounds with similar properties. Here we introduce {molBLOCKS}, a suite of programs for breaking down sets of small molecules into fragments according to a predefined set of chemical rules, clustering the resulting fragments, and uncovering statistically enriched fragments. Among other applications, our software should be a great aid in large-scale chemical analysis of ligands binding specific targets of interest.

	abstract = {The line-digraph of a digraph D with vertices V1, …, Vn is the digraph D∗ obtained from D by associating with each edge of D a vertex of D∗, and then directing an edge from vertex (Vi, Vj) of D∗ to vertex (Vk, Vm) if and only if j = k. This paper extends a characterization given by Harary and Norman for linedigraphs. It is also possible to repeatedly contract vertices of the line-digraph (with a new contraction procedure) so as to obtain the digraph derived from D by deleting all vertices with no incoming edges. Several new identities for arborescences are presented, leading to a combinatorial proof of Knuth's formula for the number of arborescences of a line-digraph. A new proof is given for the fact that in a digraph with every vertex having indegree equal to outdegree, the number of arborescences with root Vj is independent of j. Finally a new proof is presented for Tutte's Matrix Tree Theorem which shows the theorem to be a special case of the principle of inclusion-exclusion.},

After presenting several practical applications of mixed integer programming, we describe the main classes of algorithms, branch-and-bound and branch-and-cut, that are used to solve this hard class of problems. Considerable attention is paid to ways to improve solution times, involving preprocessing, reformulation with cuts and/or new variables, and heuristics.},

Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.},

	abstract = {The maximum common subgraph problem is to find the largest subgraph common to two given graphs. This problem can be solved either by constraint-based search, or by reduction to the maximum clique problem. We evaluate these two models using modern algorithms, and see that the best choice depends mainly upon whether the graphs have labelled edges. We also study a variant of this problem where the subgraph is required to be connected. We introduce a filtering algorithm for this property and show that it may be combined with a restricted branching technique for the constraint-based approach. We show how to implement a similar branching technique in clique-inspired algorithms. Finally, we experimentally compare approaches for the connected version, and see again that the best choice depends on whether graphs have labels.},
