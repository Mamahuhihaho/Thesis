	volume = {3},
	issn = {1074-5521},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A structurally diverse group of bioactive peptides is synthesized by peptide synthetases which act as templates for a growing peptide chain, attached to the enzyme via a thioester bond. The protein templates are composed of distinctive substrate-activating modules, whose order dictates the primary structure of the corresponding peptide product. Each module contains defined domains that catalyze adenylation, thioester and peptide bond formation, as well as substrate modifications. To show that a putative thiolation domain ({PCP}) is involved in covalent binding and transfer of amino acyl residues during non-ribosomal peptide synthesis, we have cloned and biochemically characterized that region of tyrocidine synthetase 1, {TycA}.
{RESULTS}: The 327-bp gene fragment encoding {PCP} was cloned using its homology to the genes for the acyl carrier proteins of fatty acid and polyketide biosynthesis. The protein was expressed as a His6 fusion protein, and purified in a single step by affinity chromatography. Incorporation of beta-[3H]alanine, a precursor of coenzyme A, demonstrated the modification of {PCP} with the cofactor 4'-phosphopantetheine. When an adenylation domain is present to supply the amino adenylate moiety, {PCP} can be acylated in vitro.
{CONCLUSIONS}: {PCP} can bind covalently to the cofactor phosphopantetheine and can subsequently be acylated, strongly supporting the multiple carrier model of non-ribosomal peptide synthesis. The adenylation and thiolation domains can each act as independent multifunctional enzymes, further confirming the modular structure of peptide synthases, and can also perform sequential steps in trans, as do multienzyme complexes.},

We previously showed that substitution of the condensation (C) and adenylation (A) domains in module 2 of the pyoverdine synthetase {PvdD} from Pseudomonas aeruginosa led to synthesis of modified pyoverdines in a minority of cases, but that more often the recombinant enzymes were non-functional. One possible explanation was that the majority of introduced C domains were unable to effectively communicate with the thiolation (T) domain immediately upstream, in the first module of {PvdD}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Many pharmacologically important peptides are synthesized nonribosomally by multimodular peptide synthetases ({NRPSs}). These enzyme templates consist of iterated modules that, in their number and organization, determine the primary structure of the corresponding peptide products. At the core of each module is an adenylation domain that recognizes the cognate substrate and activates it as its aminoacyl adenylate. Recently, the crystal structure of the phenylalanine-activating adenylation domain {PheA} was solved with phenylalanine and {AMP}, illustrating the structural basis for substrate recognition.
{RESULTS}: By comparing the residues that line the phenylalanine-binding pocket in {PheA} with the corresponding moieties in other adenylation domains, general rules for deducing substrate specificity were developed. We tested these in silico 'rules' by mutating specificity-conferring residues within {PheA}. The substrate specificity of most mutants was altered or relaxed. Generalization of the selectivity determinants also allowed the targeted specificity switch of an aspartate-activating adenylation domain, the crystal structure of which has not yet been solved, by introducing a single mutation.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In silico studies and structure-function mutagenesis have defined general rules for the structural basis of substrate recognition in adenylation domains of {NRPSs}. These rules can be used to rationally alter the specificity of adenylation domains and to predict from the primary sequence the specificity of biochemically uncharacterized adenylation domains. Such efforts could enhance the structural diversity of peptide antibiotics such as penicillins, cyclosporins and vancomycins by allowing synthesis of 'unnatural' natural products.},

	volume = {273},
	issn = {0021-9258},
	abstract = {Recently, considerable insight has been gained into the modular organization and catalytic properties of nonribosomal peptide synthetases. However, molecular and biochemical aspects of the condensation of two aminoacyl substrates or a peptidyl and an aminoacyl substrate, leading to the formation of a peptide bond, have remained essentially impenetrable. To investigate this crucial part of nonribosomal peptide synthesis, an in vitro assay for a dipeptide formation was developed. Two recombinant holomodules, {GrsA} ({PheATE}), providing D-Phe, and a C-terminally truncated {TycB}, corresponding to the first, L-Pro-incorporating module ({ProCAT}), were investigated. Upon combination of the two aminoacylated modules, a fast reaction is observed, due to the formation of the linear dipeptide D-Phe-L-Pro-S-enzyme on {ProCAT}, followed by a noncatalyzed release of the dipeptide from the enzyme. The liberated product was identified by {TLC}, high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, 1H and 13C {NMR}, and comparison with a chemically synthesized standard to be the expected D-Phe-L-Pro diketopiperazine. Further minimization of the two modules was not possible without a loss of transfer activity. Likewise, a mutation in a proposed active-site motif ({HHXXXDG}) of the condensation domain giving {ProCAT}(H147V), abolished the condensation reaction. These results strongly suggest the condensation domain to be involved in the catalysis of nonribosomal peptide bond formation with the histidine 147 playing a catalytic role.},

However identifying new biologically active small molecules is still a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a new activity prediction approach using Bayesian belief network for classification ({BBNC}). The roots of the network are the fragments composing a compound. The leaves are, on one side, the activities to predict and, on another side, the unknown compound. The activities are represented by sets of known compounds, and sets of inactive compounds are also used. We calculated a similarity between an unknown compound and each activity class. The more similar activity is assigned to the unknown compound. We applied this new approach on eight well-known data sets extracted from the literature and compared its performance to three classical machine learning algorithms. Experiments showed that {BBNC} provides interesting prediction rates (from 79\% accuracy for high diverse data sets to 99\% for low diverse ones) with a short time calculation. Experiments also showed that {BBNC} is particularly effective for homogeneous data sets but has been found to perform less well with structurally heterogeneous sets. However, it is important to stress that we believe that using several approaches whenever possible for activity prediction can often give a broader understanding of the data than using only one approach alone. Thus, {BBNC} is a useful addition to the computational chemist?s toolbox.},

This paper extends a characterization given by Harary and Norman for linedigraphs. It is also possible to repeatedly contract vertices of the line-digraph (with a new contraction procedure) so as to obtain the digraph derived from D by deleting all vertices with no incoming edges. Several new identities for arborescences are presented, leading to a combinatorial proof of Knuth's formula for the number of arborescences of a line-digraph. A new proof is given for the fact that in a digraph with every vertex having indegree equal to outdegree, the number of arborescences with root Vj is independent of j.

	abstract = {A linear mixed integer program is an optimization problem in which a nonempty subset of integer variables (unknowns) and a subset of real-valued (continuous) variables exist, the constraints are all linear equations or inequalities, and the objective is a linear function to be minimized (or maximized). After presenting several practical applications of mixed integer programming, we describe the main classes of algorithms, branch-and-bound and branch-and-cut, that are used to solve this hard class of problems. Considerable attention is paid to ways to improve solution times, involving preprocessing, reformulation with cuts and/or new variables, and heuristics.},

	abstract = {A large class of computational problems involve the determination of properties of graphs, digraphs, integers, arrays of integers, finite families of finite sets, boolean formulas and elements of other countable domains. Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.},
