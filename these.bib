	abstract = {Natural products and synthetic compounds are a valuable source of new small molecules leading to novel drugs to cure diseases. However identifying new biologically active small molecules is still a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a new activity prediction approach using Bayesian belief network for classification ({BBNC}). The roots of the network are the fragments composing a compound. The leaves are, on one side, the activities to predict and, on another side, the unknown compound. The activities are represented by sets of known compounds, and sets of inactive compounds are also used. We calculated a similarity between an unknown compound and each activity class. The more similar activity is assigned to the unknown compound. We applied this new approach on eight well-known data sets extracted from the literature and compared its performance to three classical machine learning algorithms. Experiments showed that {BBNC} provides interesting prediction rates (from 79\% accuracy for high diverse data sets to 99\% for low diverse ones) with a short time calculation. Experiments also showed that {BBNC} is particularly effective for homogeneous data sets but has been found to perform less well with structurally heterogeneous sets. However, it is important to stress that we believe that using several approaches whenever possible for activity prediction can often give a broader understanding of the data than using only one approach alone. Thus, {BBNC} is a useful addition to the computational chemist?s toolbox.},

	abstract = {Bacteria and fungi use a set of enzymes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases to provide a wide range of natural peptides displaying structural and biological diversity. So, nonribosomal peptides ({NRPs}) are the basis for some efficient drugs. While discovering new {NRPs} is very desirable, the process of identifying their biological activity to be used as drugs is a challenge. In this paper, we present a novel peptide fingerprint based on monomer composition ({MCFP}) of {NRPs}. {MCFP} is a novel method for obtaining a representative description of {NRP} structures from their monomer composition in fingerprint form. Experiments with Norine {NRPs} database and {MCFP} show high prediction accuracy ({\textgreater}93 \%). Also a high recall rate ({\textgreater}82 \%) is obtained when {MCFP} is used for screening {NRPs} database. From this study it appears that our fingerprint, built from monomer composition, allows an effective screening and prediction of biological activities of {NRPs} database.},

	abstract = {Summary: The chemical structures of biomolecules, whether naturally occurring or synthetic, are composed of functionally important building blocks. Given a set of small molecules—for example, those known to bind a particular protein—computationally decomposing them into chemically meaningful fragments can help elucidate their functional properties, and may be useful for designing novel compounds with similar properties. Here we introduce {molBLOCKS}, a suite of programs for breaking down sets of small molecules into fragments according to a predefined set of chemical rules, clustering the resulting fragments, and uncovering statistically enriched fragments. Among other applications, our software should be a great aid in large-scale chemical analysis of ligands binding specific targets of interest.

This paper extends a characterization given by Harary and Norman for linedigraphs. It is also possible to repeatedly contract vertices of the line-digraph (with a new contraction procedure) so as to obtain the digraph derived from D by deleting all vertices with no incoming edges. Several new identities for arborescences are presented, leading to a combinatorial proof of Knuth's formula for the number of arborescences of a line-digraph. A new proof is given for the fact that in a digraph with every vertex having indegree equal to outdegree, the number of arborescences with root Vj is independent of j. Finally a new proof is presented for Tutte's Matrix Tree Theorem which shows the theorem to be a special case of the principle of inclusion-exclusion.},

It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.},
